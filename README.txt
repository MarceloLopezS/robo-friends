This is a simple React project that retrieves random user data from an API and 
displays users inside card elements. These contain their information and a 
profile picture which is a random-generated robot image, also retrieved from 
another API.

The web app allows the user to search a robo-user by name, filtering the card 
elements and displaying only the ones that match or include the user text 
input.

The web app is also fully responsive across desktop and mobile devices.
